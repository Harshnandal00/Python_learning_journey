# Day 01 – Python Basics

# ----- Basic Variables -----
name = "Harsh"
age = 18
college = "Jaat"

print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("College:", college)

# ----- Data Types -----
print(type(name))
print(type(age))
print(type(college))

# ----- Simple Operations -----
print("Age after 5 years:", age + 5)
print("Full Name:", name + " Nandal")
print("College Location:", college + " College Rohtak")

# ----- User Input -----
user_name = input("Please enter your name: ")
user_age = input("Please enter your age: ")
user_college = input("Please enter your college name: ")

print("Hello,", user_name)

# Convert age to integer
user_age = int(user_age)
print("Your age after 5 years will be:", user_age + 5)
print("Your college name is:", user_college)

# ----- What I learned today -----
# 1. Coding is fun
# 2. Variables store data
# 3. input() always returns a string
# 4. int() converts string to integer
# 5. Errors are part of learning
# Concepts I Have ACTUALLY Learned Today

# Variables & naming

# print()

# type()

# String concatenation

# input()

# Type conversion (int())

# mini project
fav_number = int(input("Enter your favorite number: "))
print("Double of your number is: ", fav_number * 2)
