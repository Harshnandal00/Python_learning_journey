# Create a class with a class attribute a; 
# create an object from it and set ‘a’ directly using 
# ‘object.a = 0’. Does this change the class attribute?
class demo:
    a = 3

o = demo()
print(o.a)
o.a = 2
print(o.a)# It actually doesn't change the class attribute because
# it will always remain 3 and the instance attr. is only taking its
# place...!! For example:
print(demo.a)# it again called the class attr. and it was still 3.
